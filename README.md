# nauczsieczasow
A page where you can learn about the English tenses. The website is in Polish and is made especially for the speakers of this language. It is pure HTML and CSS since I tried to find out how to manage things with flexbox and grid. I still need some practice, nevertheless the website is responsive and that's what really mattered for me.
